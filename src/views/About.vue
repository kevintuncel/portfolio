      <h1 class="">About me</h1>
      <p class="text-lg">Hi! I'm Kevin, a 22-year-old web developer from Oudsbergen, Belgium. I recently graduated from PXL Hasselt, where I honed my skills in front-end and web development.
        Outside of coding, I'm passionate about gaming and music—both listening and creating my own tracks.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="text-lg">This is a temporary portfolio as I’m currently exploring and learning Webflow to level up my design and development skills. Thanks for checking out my work!</p>
